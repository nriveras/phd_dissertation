abstract = {When restoring dryland ecosystems, growing biological soil crust (biocrust) may greatly change the redistribution of rainfall in layered soils. However, ecohydrological modelling studies generally ignore biocrust and thus, the ecohydrological effects of biocrust on restorations remain largely unexplored. Using a long-term restoration case (located in the southeast edge of the Tengger Desert, northern China), we developed an ecohydrological model with explicit consideration of the infiltration in three layered soils (biocrust, shallow and deep sand layers) to investigate influences of biocrust on restoration dynamics in drylands. The proportion of infiltration that reaches ‘annual grass’ (including biocrust and shallow sand layers, 0–30 cm) and ‘shrub’ layers (30–150 cm) with biocrust significantly increased and decreased relative to the values without biocrust, respectively. Meanwhile, biocrust significantly decreased soil water content in deep sand layer, but not in shallow sand layer. As more water was used by transpiration than evaporation, the ecosystem with biocrust reached a final grass-dominated state (high grass cover of 40%, low shrub cover of 4%) rather than a shrub-dominated state (grass cover of 3%, shrub cover of 20%). This study suggests that we need to account for the roles of biocrust on rainfall infiltration to better understand vegetation and restoration dynamics in dryland ecosystems.}

abstract = {Abstract The Atacama Desert is the driest non-polar desert on Earth, presenting precarious conditions for biological activity. In the arid coastal belt, life is restricted to areas with fog events that cause almost daily wet–dry cycles. In such an area, we discovered a hitherto unknown and unique ground covering biocenosis dominated by lichens, fungi, and algae attached to grit-sized (~6 mm) quartz and granitoid stones. Comparable biocenosis forming a kind of a layer on top of soil and rock surfaces in general is summarized as cryptogamic ground covers (CGC) in literature. In contrast to known CGC from arid environments to which frequent cyclic wetting events are lethal, in the Atacama Desert every fog event is answered by photosynthetic activity of the soil community and thus considered as the desert's breath. Photosynthesis of the new CGC type is activated by the lowest amount of water known for such a community worldwide thus enabling the unique biocenosis to fulfill a variety of ecosystem services. In a considerable portion of the coastal Atacama Desert, it protects the soil from sporadically occurring splash erosion and contributes to the accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen as well as soil formation through bio-weathering. The structure and function of the new CGC type are discussed, and we suggest the name grit–crust. We conclude that this type of CGC can be expected in all non-polar fog deserts of the world and may resemble the cryptogam communities that shaped ancient Earth. It may thus represent a relevant player in current and ancient biogeochemical cycling.},

This study investigated two terricolous and two epiphytic lichens from the fog oasis “Las Lomitas” within the National Park Pan de Azúcar which represents a refugium for a few vascular desert plants and many lichens that can thrive on fog and dew alone. Ecophysiological measurements and climate records were combined with molecular data of the mycobiont, their green algal photobionts and lichenicolous fungi to gain information about the ecology of lichens within the fog oasis. Phylogenetic and morphological investigations led to the identification and description of the new lichen species Acarospora conafii sp. nov. as well as the lichenicolous fungi that accompanied them and revealed the trebouxioid character of all lichen photobionts. Their photosynthetic responses were compared during natural scenarios such as reactivation by high air humidity and in situ fog events to elucidate the activation strategies of this lichen community. Epiphytic lichens showed photosynthetic activity that was rapidly induced by fog and high relative air humidity whereas terricolous lichens were only activated by fog.},

We employed replicated, spatially nested sampling and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to describe the soil microbial communities in three soils derived from different parent material (sandstone, shale, and gypsum). For each soil type, two depths (biocrusts, 0–1 cm; below-crust soils, 2–5 cm) and two horizontal spatial scales (15 cm and 5 m) were sampled. In all three soils, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria demonstrated significantly higher relative abundance in the biocrusts, while Chloroflexi and Archaea were significantly enriched in the below-crust soils. Biomass and diversity of the communities in biocrusts or below-crust soils did not differ with soil type. However, biocrusts on gypsum soil harbored significantly larger populations of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and lower populations of Cyanobacteria. Numerically dominant operational taxonomic units (OTU; 97\% sequence identity) in the biocrusts were conserved across the soil types, whereas two dominant OTUs in the below-crust sand and shale soils were not identified in the gypsum soil. The uniformity with which small-scale vertical community differences are maintained across larger horizontal spatial scales and soil types is a feature of dryland ecosystems that should be considered when designing management plans and determining the response of biocrusts to environmental disturbances.},

abstract="In low-nutrient environments with few vascular plant symbiotic N fixers, biocrusts play an important role in ecosystem N cycling. A large number of studies across a wide range of biomes clearly confirm that not only the presence of biocrusts but biocrust community composition strongly influences N-fixation activity, with N fixation increasing with level of development (cyanobacterial-lichen biocrusts{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}dark cyanobacterial biocrust (e.g., Nostoc spp. and Collema spp.){\thinspace}>{\thinspace}light Microcoleus-dominated biocrust). Nitrogen fixation by biocrusts results in N release to the soil in a variety of N forms (inorganic and organic N), thus elevating soil inorganic N pools in the top few millimeters of soil. The influence of N release on the bulk soil at greater soil depths is less clear, with biocrusts either elevating or having no influence on bulk soil inorganic N pools. The fate of N fixed and released by biocrusts, and whether this N is retained in the ecosystem in either soils or plants, determines ecosystem N balance over longer time scales, and results on the influence of biocrusts are mixed. Whereas we have multiple studies that examine a single compartment of N budgets, we lack studies that simultaneously address N inputs, losses, and soil and plant pools, thus precluding the construction of definitive N balances. One of the most consistent impact biocrusts have on ecosystem N is reducing N loss via wind and water erosion, with such losses consistently decreasing with increasing biocrust development.",

Here we use a different method, based on estimates of net carbon uptake, to quantify the impacts of lichens and bryophytes on biogeochemical cycles at the global scale. We focus on three processes, namely, nitrogen fixation, phosphorus uptake, and chemical weathering. Our estimates have the form of potential rates, which means that we quantify the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus needed by the organisms to build up biomass, also accounting for resorption and leaching of nutrients. Subsequently, we use potential phosphorus uptake on bare ground to estimate chemical weathering by the organisms, assuming that they release weathering agents to obtain phosphorus. The predicted requirement for nitrogen ranges from 3.5 to 34 Tgyr−1 and for phosphorus it ranges from 0.46 to 4.6 Tgyr−1. Estimates of chemical weathering are between 0.058 and 1.1 km3 yr−1 of rock. These values seem to have a realistic order of magnitude, and they support the notion that lichens and bryophytes have the potential to play an important role for biogeochemical cycles.},

abstract = {Soil erosion threatens ecosystem functioning by reducing soil organic carbon stocks or relocating nutrients. A common measure to protect soil against erosion is afforestation. There is growing evidence that mixed-species forest stands have beneficial effects on ecosystem functions (growth rates, nutrient cycling). In addition, species-rich forests tend to have higher and denser crown cover and thus might affect soil erosion. This study investigated the role of tree species richness on throughfall kinetic energy (TKE) as an important part of the soil erosion process and examined the spatial variability of TKE in mixed-species forest stands. The research was conducted within BEF-China, a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China. In summer 2013, 1800 TKE measurements were carried out during five rainfall events. TKE was measured using splash cups and related to tree height, crown base height, number of branches, leaf area index, stem ground diameter and crown area. Our experiment showed that TKE was not influenced by tree species richness at the plot level. This is likely due to the young age of the experimental forest where a dense and high tree canopy has not yet been developed. However, TKE was influenced by neighborhood tree species richness indicating that tree species richness only affected TKE on a small spatial scale within the direct neighborhood in young forests. TKE showed distinct spatial variability. Directly below the first branch of the tree individuals TKE was lowest (430J/m2) while it was highest in the middle of four tree individuals (556J/m2). Mean freefall kinetic energy (FKE) was 480J/m2. Lower TKE below the first branch than FKE can be attributed to low rain drop velocities due to short falling heights. Higher TKE in the middle of four tree individuals than FKE can be ascribed to a larger crown area on which drops can confluence resulting in an increase of drop mass. Furthermore, TKE was positively affected by the number of influencing tree individuals with a 13% increase of TKE from one to four influencing tree individuals. However, further investigation on TKE below mature trees and dense canopies is needed to confirm our findings for later successional stages.}

Within this study disturbed, early- mid- and late successional stages of BSC development were examined along a recovery transect. The results show an increase in water repellency and a decrease in water sorptivity and conductivity with ongoing BSC succession. Penetration resistance data shows very stable thin surface protection by cyanobacteria in early successional BSC that is non-repellent. Later successional stages show increased water repellency and lower water conductivity. We conclude that BSC development induces changes in surface structure and wettability. The soil surface wettability is strongly linked to the BSC community composition.},

abstract = {Using principal component analysis (PCA), we studied the relationships between hydraulic properties and 13C-CP/MAS-NMR shift regions of biological soil crusts (BSCs) on sand dunes under arid and temperate conditions. The arid study site was located near Nizzana, in the northwestern Negev, Israel and the temperate site was near Lieberose, Brandenburg, Germany. BSCs were sampled at each site near the dune crest, at the center of the dune slope and at the dune base. The soil texture was finer and water holding capacities (WHCs) were higher in Nizzana, whereas surface wettability was reduced in Lieberose. At both sites, BSCs caused extra WHC compared to the mineral substrate. Infiltration after wetting along both catenas generally reached a maximum after 10min and decreased after 30min. Carbohydrates were the dominating components in all of the BSCs studied, where the relative peak areas of carbohydrate-derived structures (60–110ppm) amounted to 28–46% and to 10–14% of total C-peak areas, respectively. PCA revealed that the WHC of the substrate was closely related to the amount of silt and clay, whereas the BSC induced extra WHC was closely related to carbohydrates. It was further found that water repellency was positively related to carbohydrate C, but negatively related to alkyl C. Infiltration kinetics was attributed to polysaccharide hydration and swelling. Our findings support the hypothesis that hydraulic properties of BSCs are determined by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and soil texture. Hydraulic properties in BSCs result from the combination of chemical properties related to C compounds mainly dominated by carbohydrates and physical surface properties related to texture, porosity and water holding capacity.}

abstract="In this chapter we examine the structure, composition, and function of soil biocrust (i.e., biological soil crust) communities dominated by lichens. Lichens are composite organisms resulting from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. Biocrust lichens can tolerate a wide range of abiotic stresses such as desiccation, extreme temperature, and high light intensity, making them well adapted to life in arid, semiarid, and polar deserts where resources are limited and competition from vascular plants is low. The ability of some lichens to fix atmospheric nitrogen also gives them a competitive advantage over other organisms in environments that are recovering from disturbance. Biocrust lichens perform many important ecological functions such as providing habitat for microfauna, stabilizing soils, fixing nitrogen and carbon, and enhancing water flow through the soil. However, as with other biocrust taxa, they are highly susceptible to physical disturbances such as trampling by livestock, disturbance by vehicular traffic, and fire. Biocrust lichen ecology is hampered by a lack of information on the distribution of many taxa, difficulties of identifying small organisms, and the high cost of sampling environments where biocrust lichens are likely to form a major component of the surface biota. The adoption of morphological groups for classifying biocrust lichens has helped to simplify the study of biocrust community ecology, but more sophisticated DNA sequencing techniques are needed in order to better understand their ecology, distribution, and how they interact with other soil crust organisms.",

The Alfisol and the Mollisol appeared to break down in steps; macroaggregates >250 µm diameter breaking down to microaggregates 20-250 µm diameter before particles <20 µm were released. Vigorous disruption led to particle size distributions similar to those obtained by classical methods used to determine particle size distributions. The Oxisol was stable to rapid wetting treatments but when aggregate disruption was initiated by vigorous treatments particles <20 µm diameter were released and there was no evidence of aggregate hierarchy. Scanning electron microscopy of particles of different sizes showed distinctly single grain particles and aggregates. The microscopic studies indicated the potential role of roots and hyphae in the stabilization of larger aggregates, and for fragments of roots as nuclei for smaller aggregates. Plant debris was not visible in aggregates <20 µm but clay microstructure was evident. It is suggested that aggregate hierarchy occurs in Alfisols and Mollisols because organic materials are the dominant stabilizing agents in larger aggregates but in the Oxisol oxides are dominant stabilizing agents and prevent the expression of aggregate hierarchy caused by organic materials.},

abstract = {The Chilean Coastal Cordillera features a spectacular climate and vegetation gradient, ranging from arid and unvegetated areas in the north to humid and forested areas in the south. The EarthShape project (“Earth Surface Shaping by Biota”) uses this natural gradient to investigate how climate and biological processes shape the Earth's surface. We explored the Critical Zone, the Earth's uppermost layer, in four key sites located in desert, semidesert, Mediterranean, and temperate climate zones of the Coastal Cordillera, with the focus on weathering of granitic rock. Here, we present first results from 16 approximately 2 m-deep regolith profiles to document: (1) architecture of weathering zone; (2) degree and rate of rock weathering, thus the release of mineral-derived nutrients to the terrestrial ecosystems; (3) denudation rates; and (4) microbial abundances of bacteria and archaea in the saprolite. From north to south, denudation rates from cosmogenic nuclides are ~10 t km−2 yr−1 at the arid Pan de Azúcar site, ~20 t km−2 yr−1 at the semi-arid site of Santa Gracia, ~60 t km−2 yr−1 at the Mediterranean climate site of La Campana, and ~30 t km−2 yr−1 at the humid site of Nahuelbuta. A and B horizons increase in thickness and elemental depletion or enrichment increases from north (~26°S) to south (~38°S) in these horizons. Differences in the degree of chemical weathering, quantified by the chemical depletion fraction (CDF), are significant only between the arid and sparsely vegetated site and the other three sites. Differences in the CDF between the sites, and elemental depletion within the sites are sometimes smaller than the variations induced by the bedrock heterogeneity. Microbial abundances (bacteria and archaea) in saprolite substantially increase from the arid to the semi-arid sites. With this study, we provide a comprehensive dataset characterizing the Critical Zone geochemistry in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera. This dataset confirms climatic controls on weathering and denudation rates and provides prerequisites to quantify the role of biota in future studies.}

   abstract = {Wind is known to affect the spatial heterogeneity of soil resources in arid and semiarid systems, but multi-year, quantified observations are largely absent. We studied the effects of wind erosion on the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and other soil nutrients at the Jornada Experimental Range, in southern New Mexico. Enhanced wind erosion was encouraged by grass cover reduction in a Sporobolus-mesquite dominated site (SM) and a Bouteloua-mesquite dominated site (BM). The scale and magnitude of spatial dependence for the soil analytes were quantified using geostatistical analyses. Results of this study show that soil organic matter related analytes such as SOC, TN, Navail, and SO42­ are among the first to be eroded and redistributed; cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ may not be removed and redistributed significantly; and other ions such as K+, Na+ and Cl− showed no discernible pattern of change. Geostatistics show that wind appeared to increase the scale of spatial autocorrelation, but decrease the scale of spatial dependence of most soil analytes over 2–3 windy seasons. In the wind enhanced plot of the SM site, up to 99% of the spatial dependence of SOC was autocorrelated at the distance of 1.45 m before the initiation of wind erosion, but the spatial dependence dropped significantly to only 60% at a larger autocorrelation distance of 2.76 m after three windy seasons. Similar but less significant changes were observed for SOC in the BM site. Despite the differential effects of wind on the soil analytes, we conclude that the overall results of wind on the grass cover reduction plots are the disappearance of small, strong fertile islands, which may be related to grasses; and the reinforcement of large fertile islands, which are likely related to mesquite shrubs. In addition, the change of the spatial patterns of SOC and other soil nutrients induced by enhanced wind erosion may persist and reinforce soil islands associated with shrubs, thus allowing a positive feedback for further desertification in this arid grassland.},

abstract = {Biodiversity of phototrophic microorganisms in South American biological soil crusts (BSCs) and their role in the biogeochemical phosphorus (P)-cycle are unknown. Richness of BSC green algae and cyanobacteria was investigated at four climatically different Chilean sites (arid, semi-arid, Mediterranean, humid). Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and P contents, P pools and P speciation as well as spatial P species distribution within the BSCs were investigated. Morphological identification of enrichment cultures revealed 24 green algal and 18 cyanobacterial taxa in total. Irrespective of climatic conditions, each BSC comprised 12 to 15 different phototrophic species. Thereby, green algal richness increased, while cyanobacterial richness decreased with increasing humidity/decreasing mean annual temperature (North to South). Total C, N, and S contents ranged between 6.7 and 41.1 g C kg−1, 0.6–2.8 g N kg−1 and 0.2–0.7 g S kg−1, respectively, and increased in the order crust-free soil < crust-adhering soil < BSC. The total P content in BSCs ranged from 310 to 777 mg kg−1 with lowest concentrations at the arid site and highest concentrations at the semi-arid site. Labile P was highest in BSCs from semi-arid and Mediterranean climate implying no P-shortage for BSC organisms at these sites. In BSCs of all sites, stable and non-extractable P was identified as the major P pool (sequential P fractionation) with Ca-P species dominating at all sites except for the humid site at which Al-P was the main P species as determined by P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure, XANES. P K-edge μ-XANES of BSC cross sections revealed apatite hotspots, a potential P source for BSC organisms except for the arid site, where other Ca-P species dominated. Further, elemental mapping of the arid BSC cross section showed distinct accumulation of S and chloride (Cl) containing compounds within green algae and on their outer surface, respectively, raising the question of function/origin of these compounds. In conclusion, this work expands our knowledge on the richness of phototrophic organisms in South American BSCs and characterizes their possible position in the P-cycle along a strong climatic gradient. Our findings suggest that biotic and abiotic factors shape the structure of BSCs phototrophic communities as well as P pools and species at each habitat.}

Alternative soil management practices such as no tillage, reduced tillage and temporary leys, however, can minimize the negative effects of intensive tillage on soil structure. To improve understanding of these management practices on soil structure, we sampled a field trial combining organic and conventional crop management with different intensity levels of tillage, resulting in four cropping systems: conventional intensive tillage (C-IT), conventional no tillage (C-NT), organic intensive tillage (O-IT) and organic reduced tillage (O-RT). A ley period was added following a 4-year arable crop rotation. We measured mean weight diameter (MWD), total C and total nitrogen (N) in whole unfractionated soil and water-stable aggregate fractions after the 4-year arable crop rotation and again after a following 2-year grass-clover ley period, to assess the impact of the cropping system and the ley, respectively. Results showed that 4 years of organic crop management including the application of cattle manure slurry combined with reduced tillage led to significantly better soil structure (i.e. aggregate MWD) at the 0–6 cm soil depth, compared to the other cropping systems tested. After the ley period, the proportion of large macroaggregates increased by 65% for C-IT and 47% for O-IT at 0–6 cm depth. Total C increased significantly for only O-IT and O-RT after the ley, both of which also showed a high C stratification between 0–6 cm and 6-20 cm depth. In conclusion, soil structure is most improved during continuous cropping when combining organic crop management with reduced tillage, while a ley period was effective in improving the soil structure in intensive tillage plots to the level of O-RT.}
