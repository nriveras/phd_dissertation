   title = {Biocrusts as Climate-Dependent Regulators of Erosion, Water and Nutrient Cycling},
   abstract = {Biocrusts, complex communities of organisms, significantly alter surface and sub-surface processes, including water infiltration, and the cycling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). While their importance is recognized, studies across broad climatic gradients are scarce. We conducted rainfall simulation experiments at four sites along a 910 km Chilean Coastal Range transect, representing coastal and inland semi-arid, mediterranean, and humid climates. We quantified overland flow, sediment discharge, and fluxes of C and N in percolating water, comparing paired biocrust-covered and bare soil surfaces. Our findings reveal that biocrusts, compared to bare soil, significantly increased cumulative infiltration rates across all climates, indicating enhanced saturated hydraulic conductivity. Biocrust presence reduced runoff by 73% in humid climates and sediment flux by 80% in inland semi-arid climates. On average, soil erosion was reduced by up to 69%. Additionally, biocrusts significantly reduced C loss via erosion. Dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen fluxes were also strongly influenced by the presence of biocrusts. Overall, our study demonstrates that, though the presence of biocrust significantly reduced erosion, water and nutrient dynamics are strongly influenced by its presence and the climates, showing that biocrusts act as climate-dependent regulators of crucial surface and sub-surface transport processes.},

   title = {Vertical movement of soluble carbon and nutrients from biocrusts to subsurface mineral soils},
   journal = {Geoderma},
   volume = {405},
   pages = {115495},
   abstract = {Dryland ecosystems can be constrained by low soil fertility. Within drylands, the soil nutrient and organic carbon (C) cycling that does occur is often mediated by soil surface communities known as biological soil crusts (biocrusts), which cycle C and nutrients in the top ca. 0–2 cm of soil. However, the degree to which biocrusts are influencing soil fertility and biogeochemical cycling in deeper, subsurface mineral soils is unclear. The movement of dissolved resources from biocrusts to deeper soil layers in leachate may be one of the main mechanisms through which biocrust fertility is transferred downward towards deeper microbial communities and plant roots occurring within mineral soil. Here we examined the role of biocrust leachate in contributing to subsurface nutrient and soluble C pools and subsurface microbial cycling. We collected biocrusts from three biocrust successional stages and explored resource pools in situ at multiple soil depths, while collecting leachate and measuring nutrient and organic C concentrations and metabolite composition from each successional stage in the laboratory. After four leachate collections, we conducted an incubation of mineral soil collected from below each biocrust successional stage to measure heterotrophic microbial CO2 flux and biomass. Overall, our findings observed that the degree of nutrient and C connectivity between biocrusts and the sub-crust mineral soil depended on the biocrust successional stage and the element being considered, and the influence of biocrust successional stage on mineral soil CO2 flux is likely related to long-term resource build up. Together, our results suggest that the influence of biocrust leachate on subsurface mineral soil is complex and context dependent, but, over longer time periods and at later successional stages, can have measurable effects on dryland soil biogeochemical cycling with feedbacks to resource availability and CO2 flux.},

   journal = {Geoderma},
   volume = {424},
   pages = {116015},
   abstract = {Biocrusts are photosynthetic biotic communities of cryptogams and microbes that aggregate minerals at the soil surface in many ecosystems. Due to their high tolerance to harsh environments, biocrusts are present in a wide range of habitats, but are especially representative ground covers in regions with restricted vegetation growth, such as drylands (hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid regions) where water is a limiting factor, or high latitude or altitude regions where cold is a limiting factor. Since biocrusts fulfill a large range of ecological roles particularly in modifying soil properties and regulating functions, their rehabilitation and management is believed to be a promising measure for combating land degradation. We organized this article collection to further highlight the importance of biocrusts and their fundamental roles in reshaping soil properties and multifunctionality in drylands and other ecosystems, and to elucidate the ways in which global change factors are influencing biocrust-soil systems. The special issue brings together 27 research articles pertinent to soil-biocrust interactions or biocrust response to global change and disturbance from 12 countries worldwide (10 papers from China, 6 papers from the USA, 2 papers from Spain, 2 papers from Australia, in addition to studies from Antarctica, Argentina, Brazil, Iceland, Iran, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, and Sweden). The discussed topics include biocrust roles in regulating soil hydrology (6 papers), reducing soil erosion (4 papers), affecting soil carbon fixation and respiration (2 papers), and influencing soil microbial biodiversity (5 papers). The responses of biocrusts themselves and their functions to trampling disturbance (2 papers), land use shifts (2 papers), and climate change (5 papers) are also emphasized. On the whole, we highlight the capability of biocrusts in reshaping most properties of surface soil, acting as engineers and architects of surface soil properties, functions, and processes in dryland or other harsh environments, and we recognize the necessity of their protection and consideration as valuable nature-based measures to combat soil and land degradation.},

   pages = {1768-1785},
   abstract = {ABSTRACT Studies of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) have proliferated over the last few decades. The biocrust literature has broadened, with more studies assessing and describing the function of a variety of biocrust communities in a broad range of biomes and habitats and across a large spectrum of disciplines, and also by the incorporation of biocrusts into global perspectives and biogeochemical models. As the number of biocrust researchers increases, along with the scope of soil communities defined as ‘biocrust’, it is worth asking whether we all share a clear, universal, and fully articulated definition of what constitutes a biocrust. In this review, we synthesize the literature with the views of new and experienced biocrust researchers, to provide a refined and fully elaborated definition of biocrusts. In doing so, we illustrate the ecological relevance and ecosystem services provided by them. We demonstrate that biocrusts are defined by four distinct elements: physical structure, functional characteristics, habitat, and taxonomic composition. We describe outgroups, which have some, but not all, of the characteristics necessary to be fully consistent with our definition and thus would not be considered biocrusts. We also summarize the wide variety of different types of communities that fall under our definition of biocrusts, in the process of highlighting their global distribution. Finally, we suggest the universal use of the Belnap, Büdel & Lange definition, with minor modifications: Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) result from an intimate association between soil particles and differing proportions of photoautotrophic (e.g. cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, bryophytes) and heterotrophic (e.g. bacteria, fungi, archaea) organisms, which live within, or immediately on top of, the uppermost millimetres of soil. Soil particles are aggregated through the presence and activity of these often extremotolerant biota that desiccate regularly, and the resultant living crust covers the surface of the ground as a coherent layer. With this detailed definition of biocrusts, illustrating their ecological functions and widespread distribution, we hope to stimulate interest in biocrust research and inform various stakeholders (e.g. land managers, land users) on their overall importance to ecosystem and Earth system functioning.},

   pages = {104100},
   abstract = {The complex interactions between biocrust properties and rainfall characteristics give rise to partitioning of infiltration and runoff. In this review we examine primary mechanisms for runoff generation due to water repellency (WR), pore clogging (PC), soil texture and structural features including surface roughness. The primary hypothesis is that while WR plays an important role in runoff generation in humid regions, PC is a dominant process for runoff in arid and semiarid regions even under moderate rainfall intensities. Evidence suggests that the amount and properties of biocrust extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) dictate the rheological properties and swelling characteristics of the biocrust, which, in turn, govern the degree of pore clogging (due to surface swelling) and the resulting surface saturation. Changes in species composition of the main photoautotrophic component of the biocrust control the amount and properties of the embedded EPS. Disturbance or warmer climate may affect runoff generation via changes in biocrust species composition. These changes may not be necessarily long-lived when the disturbance is ceased or climate conditions revert to ‘original’ long term state.},

   journal = {Soil Biology and Biochemistry},
   volume = {157},
   pages = {108244},
   abstract = {Subsoils are characterized by low concentrations of organic carbon (OC). Nevertheless, they contain more than half of the global soil OC because of their large volume. This discrepancy suggests that subsoils might further sequester carbon (C), thus acting as potential sinks for atmospheric C. Plant roots and associated rhizodeposits are a major OC input source to subsoils. However, whether and how increased OC inputs via plant roots to subsoils affect soil C sequestration mechanisms remains unclear. Here we set up a pot experiment with European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) seedlings to investigate the effect of tree roots and associated rhizosphere development on soil aggregation and C allocation in topsoil vs. subsoil material collected from three forest sites of different parent materials. Over a 5-month growth period, the seedlings developed a dense root system transforming the whole soil volume into root-affected (i.e., rhizosphere) soil. We found that roots and the associated rhizosphere development increased the amount of macroaggregates in the two finest-textured subsoils. The most C-poor and fine-textured subsoil had a 15% increase in bulk OC concentration, indicating a potential for C sequestration in subsoils by enhanced macroaggregation. Across subsoils, rooting strongly enhanced microbial abundance and was especially correlated with fungal abundance and a shift in the fungal-to-bacterial- ratio. The strong fungal growth was likely the cause for the enhanced macroaggregation in these subsoils. In topsoils, however, rooting treatment decreased macroaggregate abundance, potentially through the disruption of preexisting aggregates, as indicated by the concomitant increase in microaggregates. Our study supports the growing awareness that OC dynamics may be governed by different mechanisms in top- and subsoils, respectively. It demonstrates that the enhanced addition of OM via plant roots to subsoils boosts fungal growth and thereby increases macroaggregate formation, potentially facilitating C sequestration by occlusion.},

   abstract = {Normalization transformations have recently experienced a resurgence in popularity in the era of machine learning, particularly in data preprocessing. However, the classical methods that can be adapted to cross-validation are not always effective. We introduce Ordered Quantile (ORQ) normalization, a one-to-one transformation that is designed to consistently and effectively transform a vector of arbitrary distribution into a vector that follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the absence of ties, ORQ normalization is guaranteed to produce normally distributed transformed data. Once trained, an ORQ transformation can be readily and effectively applied to new data. We compare the effectiveness of the ORQ technique with other popular normalization methods in a simulation study where the true data generating distributions are known. We find that ORQ normalization is the only method that works consistently and effectively, regardless of the underlying distribution. We also explore the use of repeated cross-validation to identify the best normalizing transformation when the true underlying distribution is unknown. We apply our technique and other normalization methods via the bestNormalize R package on a car pricing data set. We built bestNormalize to evaluate the normalization efficacy of many candidate transformations; the package is freely available via the Comprehensive R Archive Network.},

   abstract = {The capture and use of water are critically important in drylands, which collectively constitute Earth's largest biome. Drylands will likely experience lower and more unreliable rainfall as climatic conditions change over the next century. Dryland soils support a rich community of microphytic organisms (biocrusts), which are critically important because they regulate the delivery and retention of water. Yet despite their hydrological significance, a global synthesis of their effects on hydrology is lacking. We synthesized 2,997 observations from 109 publications to explore how biocrusts affected five hydrological processes (times to ponding and runoff, early [sorptivity] and final [infiltration] stages of water flow into soil, and the rate or volume of runoff) and two hydrological outcomes (moisture storage, sediment production). We found that increasing biocrust cover reduced the time for water to pond on the surface (-40%) and commence runoff (-33%), and reduced infiltration (-34%) and sediment production (-68%). Greater biocrust cover had no significant effect on sorptivity or runoff rate/amount, but increased moisture storage (+14%). Infiltration declined most (-56%) at fine scales, and moisture storage was greatest (+36%) at large scales. Effects of biocrust type (cyanobacteria, lichen, moss, mixed), soil texture (sand, loam, clay), and climatic zone (arid, semiarid, dry subhumid) were nuanced. Our synthesis provides novel insights into the magnitude, processes, and contexts of biocrust effects in drylands. This information is critical to improve our capacity to manage dwindling dryland water supplies as Earth becomes hotter and drier.},

   abstract = {Abstract All soils harbor microaggregates, i.e., compound soil structures smaller than 250 µm. These microaggregates are composed of diverse mineral, organic and biotic materials that are bound together during pedogenesis by various physical, chemical and biological processes. Consequently, microaggregates can withstand strong mechanical and physicochemical stresses and survive slaking in water, allowing them to persist in soils for several decades. Together with the physiochemical heterogeneity of their surfaces, the three-dimensional structure of microaggregates provides a large variety of ecological niches that contribute to the vast biological diversity found in soils. As reported for larger aggregate units, microaggregates are composed of smaller building units that become more complex with increasing size. In this context, organo-mineral associations can be considered structural units of soil aggregates and as nanoparticulate fractions of the microaggregates themselves. The mineral phases considered to be the most important as microaggregate forming materials are the clay minerals and Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides. Within microaggregates, minerals are bound together primarily by physicochemical and chemical interactions involving cementing and gluing agents. The former comprise, among others, carbonates and the short-range ordered phases of Fe, Mn, and Al. The latter comprise organic materials of diverse origin and probably involve macromolecules and macromolecular mixtures. Work on microaggregate structure and development has largely focused on organic matter stability and turnover. However, little is known concerning the role microaggregates play in the fate of elements like Si, Fe, Al, P, and S. More recently, the role of microaggregates in the formation of microhabitats and the biogeography and diversity of microbial communities has been investigated. Little is known regarding how microaggregates and their properties change in time, which strongly limits our understanding of micro-scale soil structure dynamics. Similarly, only limited information is available on the mechanical stability of microaggregates, while essentially nothing is known about the flow and transport of fluids and solutes within the micro- and nanoporous microaggregate systems. Any quantitative approaches being developed for the modeling of formation, structure and properties of microaggregates are, therefore, in their infancy. We respond to the growing awareness of the importance of microaggregates for the structure, properties and functions of soils by reviewing what is currently known about the formation, composition and turnover of microaggregates. We aim to provide a better understanding of their role in soil function, and to present the major unknowns in current microaggregate research. We propose a harmonized concept for aggregates in soils that explicitly considers the structure and build-up of microaggregates and the role of organo-mineral associations. We call for experiments, studies and modeling endeavors that will link information on aggregate forming materials with their functional properties across a range of scales in order to better understand microaggregate formation and turnover. Finally, we hope to inspire a novel cohort of soil scientists that they might focus their research on improving our understanding of the role of microaggregates within the system of aggregates and so help to develop a unified and quantitative concept of aggregation processes in soils.},

We use observations and environmental modelling toestimate the global distribution of biocrusts and their response to global changeusing future projected scenarios. We find that biocrusts currently coveringapproximately 12% of Earth’s terrestrial surface will decrease by about 25–40%within 65 years due to anthropogenically caused climate change and land-useintensification, responding far more drastically than vascular plants. Our resultsillustrate that current biocrust occurrence is mainly driven by a combination ofprecipitation, temperature and land management, and future changes are expected tobe affected by land-use and climate change in similar proportion. The predicted lossof biocrusts may substantially reduce the microbial contribution to nitrogen cyclingand enhance the emissions of soil dust, which affects the functioning of ecosystemsas well as human health and should be considered in the modelling, mitigation andmanagement of global change.},

   abstract = {A wide range of microorganisms produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), highly hydrated polymers that are mainly composed of polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA. EPS are fundamental for microbial life and provide an ideal environment for chemical reactions, nutrient entrapment, and protection against environmental stresses such as salinity and drought. Microbial EPS can enhance the aggregation of soil particles and benefit plants by maintaining the moisture of the environment and trapping nutrients. In addition, EPS have unique characteristics, such as biocompatibility, gelling, and thickening capabilities, with industrial applications. However, despite decades of research on the industrial potential of EPS, only a few polymers are widely used in different areas, especially in agriculture. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on the ecological functions of microbial EPSs and their application in agricultural soils to improve soil particle aggregation, an important factor for soil structure, health, and fertility.},

   journal = {Catena},
   volume = {170},
   pages = {335-355},
   abstract = {The effects of climate and topography on soil physico-chemical and microbial parameters were studied along an extensive latitudinal climate gradient in the Coastal Cordillera of Chile (26°–38°S). The study sites encompass arid (Pan de Azúcar), semiarid (Santa Gracia), mediterranean (La Campana) and humid (Nahuelbuta) climates and vegetation, ranging from arid desert, dominated by biological soil crusts (biocrusts), semiarid shrubland and mediterranean sclerophyllous forest, where biocrusts are present but do have a seasonal pattern to temperate-mixed forest, where biocrusts only occur as an early pioneering development stage after disturbance. All soils originate from granitic parent materials and show very strong differences in pedogenesis intensity and soil depth. Most of the investigated physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties showed distinct trends along the climate gradient. Further, abrupt changes between the arid northernmost study site and the other semi-arid to humid sites can be shown, which indicate non-linearity and thresholds along the climate gradient. Clay and total organic carbon contents (TOC) as well as Ah horizons and solum depths increased from arid to humid climates, whereas bulk density (BD), pH values and base saturation (BS) decreased. These properties demonstrate the accumulation of organic matter, clay formation and element leaching as key-pedogenic processes with increasing humidity. However, the soils in the northern arid climate do not follow this overall latitudinal trend, because texture and BD are largely controlled by aeolian input of dust and sea salts spray followed by the formation of secondary evaporate minerals. Total soil DNA concentrations and TOC increased from arid to humid sites, while areal coverage by biocrusts exhibited an opposite trend. Relative bacterial and archaeal abundances were lower in the arid site, but for the other sites the local variability exceeds the variability along the climate gradient. Differences in soil properties between topographic positions were most pronounced at the study sites with the mediterranean and humid climate, whereas microbial abundances were independent on topography across all study sites. In general, the regional climate is the strongest controlling factor for pedogenesis and microbial parameters in soils developed from the same parent material. Topographic position along individual slopes of limited length augmented this effect only under humid conditions, where water erosion likely relocated particles and elements downward. The change from alkaline to neutral soil pH between the arid and the semi-arid site coincided with qualitative differences in soil formation as well as microbial habitats. This also reflects non-linear relationships of pedogenic and microbial processes in soils depending on climate with a sharp threshold between arid and semi-arid conditions. Therefore, the soils on the transition between arid and semi-arid conditions are especially sensitive and may be well used as indicators of long and medium-term climate changes. Concluding, the unique latitudinal precipitation gradient in the Coastal Cordillera of Chile is predestined to investigate the effects of the main soil forming factor – climate – on pedogenic processes.},

   journal = {Journal of Plant Ecology},
   volume = {10},
   number = {1},
   pages = {111-127},
   abstract = {The aim of our research was to understand small-scale effects of topography and soil fertility on tree growth in a forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment in subtropical SE China.Geomorphometric terrain analyses were carried out at a spatial resolution of 5×5 m. Soil samples of different depth increments and data on tree height were collected from a total of 566 plots (667 m2 each). The soils were analyzed for carbon (soil organic carbon [SOC]), nitrogen, acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations and base saturation as soil fertility attributes. All plots were classified into geomorphological units. Analyses of variance and linear regressions were applied to all terrain, soil fertility and tree growth attributes.In general, young and shallow soils and relatively small differences in stable soil properties suggest that soil erosion has truncated the soils to a large extent over the whole area of the experiment. This explains the concurrently increasing CEC and SOC stocks downslope, in hollows and in valleys. However, colluvial, carbon-rich sediments are missing widely due to the convexity of the footslopes caused by uplift and removal of eroded sediments by adjacent waterways. The results showed that soil fertility is mainly influenced by topography. Monte–Carlo flow accumulation (MCCA), curvature, slope and aspect significantly affected soil fertility. Furthermore, soil fertility was affected by the different geomorphological positions on the experimental sites with ridge and spur positions showing lower exchangeable base cation contents, especially potassium (K), due to leaching. This geomorphological effect of soil fertility is most pronounced in the topsoil and decreases when considering the subsoil down to 50cm depth. Few soil fertility attributes affect tree height after 1–2 years of growth, among which C stocks proved to be most important while pHKCl and CEC only played minor roles. Nevertheless, soil acidity and a high proportion of Al on the exchange complex affected tree height even after only 1–2 years growth. Hence, our study showed that forest nutrition is coupled to a recycling of litter nutrients, and does not only depend on subsequent supply of nutrients from the mineral soil. Besides soil fertility, topography affected tree height. We found that especially MCCA as indicator of water availability affected tree growth at small-scale, as well as aspect. Overall, our synthesis on the interrelation between fertility, topography and tree growth in a subtropical forest ecosystem in SE China showed that topographic heterogeneity lead to ecological gradients across geomorphological positions. In this respect, small-scale soil–plant interactions in a young forest can serve as a driver for the future development of vegetation and biodiversity control on soil fertility. In addition, it shows that terrain attributes should be accounted for in ecological research.},

In this chapter, we sketch the historical lines that led to the recognition of biocrusts as a community with important ecosystem functions. The idea of biocrusts as a functional ecological community has come from two main scientific branches: botany and soil science. For centuries, botanists have long recognized that multiple organisms colonize the soil surface in the open and often dry areas occurring between vascular plants. Much later, after the initial taxonomic and phytosociological descriptions were made, soil scientists and agronomists observed that these surface organisms interacted with soils in ways that changed the soil structure. In the 1970s, research on these communities as ecological units that played an important functional role in drylands began in earnest, and these studies have continued to this day. Here, we trace the history of these studies from the distant past until 1990, when biocrusts became well-known to scientists and the public.},

We refer to the species level wherever this is possible. Currently, there have been 320 species of cyanobacteria and more than 350 species of eukaryotic algae described from biocrusts. Despite this high diversity, only a minority of the cyanobacterial and algal species found is responsible for the bulk of biocrust formation. Others likely are opportunistic, utilizing the habitat created by biocrusts in the harsh regions of the Earth where habitable space is rare. We also discuss methods for the sampling and identification of biocrust algae and cyanobacteria.},

   abstract = {Evidence is mounting that the immense diversity of microorganisms and animals that live belowground contributes significantly to shaping aboveground biodiversity and the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Our understanding of how this belowground biodiversity is distributed, and how it regulates the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, is rapidly growing. Evidence also points to soil biodiversity as having a key role in determining the ecological and evolutionary responses of terrestrial ecosystems to current and future environmental change. Here we review recent progress and propose avenues for further research in this field.},

   abstract = {Antarctic glacier forefields are extreme environments and pioneer sites for ecological succession. Increasing temperatures due to global warming lead to enhanced deglaciation processes in cold-affected habitats, and new terrain is becoming exposed to soil formation and microbial colonization. However, only little is known about the impact of environmental changes on microbial communities and how they develop in connection to shifting habitat characteristics. In this study, using a combination of molecular and geochemical analysis, we determine the structure and development of bacterial communities depending on soil parameters in two different glacier forefields on Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. Our results demonstrate that deglaciation-dependent habitat formation, resulting in a gradient in soil moisture, pH and conductivity, leads to an orderly bacterial succession for some groups, for example Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Deltaproteobacteria in a transect representing 'classical' glacier forefields. A variable bacterial distribution and different composed communities were revealed according to soil heterogeneity in a slightly 'matured' glacier forefield transect, where Gemmatimonadetes, Flavobacteria, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria occur depending on water availability and soil depth. Actinobacteria are dominant in both sites with dominance connected to certain trace elements in the glacier forefields.},

   abstract = {A major thrust of terrestrial microbial ecology is focused on understanding when and how the composition of the microbial community affects the functioning of biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem scale (meters-to-kilometers and days-to-years). While research has demonstrated these linkages for physiologically and phylogenetically "narrow" processes such as trace gas emissions and nitrification, there is less conclusive evidence that microbial community composition influences the "broad" processes of decomposition and organic matter (OM) turnover in soil. In this paper, we consider how soil microbial community structure influences C cycling. We consider the phylogenetic level at which microbes form meaningful guilds, based on overall life history strategies, and suggest that these are associated with deep evolutionary divergences, while much of the species-level diversity probably reflects functional redundancy. We then consider under what conditions it is possible for differences among microbes to affect process dynamics, and argue that while microbial community structure may be important in the rate of OM breakdown in the rhizosphere and in detritus, it is likely not important in the mineral soil. In mineral soil, physical access to occluded or sorbed substrates is the rate-limiting process. Microbial community influences on OM turnover in mineral soils are based on how organisms allocate the C they take up - not only do the fates of the molecules differ, but they can affect the soil system differently as well. For example, extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharides can be key controls on soil structure and function. How microbes allocate C may also be particularly important for understanding the long-term fate of C in soil - is it sequestered or not?},

   abstract = {The exploration of spatial patterns of abundance and diversity patterns along precipitation gradients has focused for centuries on plants and animals; microbial profiles along such gradients are largely unknown. We studied the effects of soil pH, nutrient concentration, salinity, and water content on bacterial abundance and diversity in soils collected from Mediterranean, semi-arid, and arid sites receiving approximately 400, 300, and 100 mm annual precipitation, respectively. Bacterial diversity was evaluated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and clone library analyses and the patterns obtained varied with the climatic regions. Over 75% of the sequenced clones were unique to their environment, while approximately 2% were shared by all sites, yet, the Mediterranean and semi-arid sites had more common clones ( approximately 9%) than either had with the arid site (4.7% and 6%, respectively). The microbial abundance, estimated by phospholipid fatty acids and real-time quantitative PCR assays, was significantly lower in the arid region. Our results indicate that although soil bacterial abundance decreases with precipitation, bacterial diversity is independent of precipitation gradient. Furthermore, community composition was found to be unique to each ecosystem.},

   abstract = {Simultaneous inference is a common problem in many areas of application. If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

   abstract = {Abstract Naturally occurring wetting-and-drying cycles often enhance aggregation and give rise to a stable soil structure. In comparatively dry regions, such as large areas of Australia, organic-matter (OM) contents in topsoils of arable land are usually small. Therefore, the effects of wetting and drying are almost solely reliant on the clay content. To investigate the relations between wetting-and-drying cycles, aggregation, clay content, and OM in the Australian environment, an experiment was set up to determine the relative influence of both clay content (23%, 31%, 34%, and 38%) and OM amendments of barley straw (equivalent to 3.1 t ha–1, 6.2 t ha–1, and 12.4 t ha–1) on the development of water-stable aggregates in agricultural soil. The aggregate stability of each of the sixteen composite soils was determined after one, three, and six wet/dry cycles and subsequent fast and slow prewetting and was then compared to the aggregate stabilities of all other composite soils. While a single wet/dry cycle initiated soil structural evolution in all composite soils, enhancing macroaggregation, the incorporation of barley straw was most effective for the development of water-stable aggregates in those soils with 34% and 38% clay. Repeated wetting-and-drying events revealed that soil aggregation is primarily based on the clay content of the soil, but that large straw additions also tend to enhance soil aggregation. Relative to untreated soil, straw additions equivalent to 3.1 t ha–1 and 12.4 t ha–1 increased soil aggregation by about 100% and 250%, respectively, after three wet/dry cycles and fast prewetting, but were of less influence with subsequent wet/dry cycles. Straw additions were even more effective in aggregating soil when combined with slow prewetting; after three wet/dry cycles, the mean weight diameters of aggregates were increased by 70% and 140% with the same OM additions and by 160% and 290% after six wet/dry cycles, compared to samples without organic amendments. We suggest that in arable soils poor in OM and with a field texture grade of clay loam or finer, the addition of straw, which is often available from preceding crops, may be useful for improving aggregation. For a satisfactory degree of aggregate stability and an improved soil structural form, we found that straw additions of at least 6.2 t ha–1 were required. However, rapid wetting of straw-amended soil will disrupt newly formed aggregates, and straw has only a limited ability to sustain structural improvement.},

   abstract = {The soils of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile have long been known to contain large quantities of unusual salts, yet the processes that form these soils are not yet fully understood. We examined the morphology and geochemistry of soils on post-Miocene fans and stream terraces along a south-to-north (27° to 24° S) rainfall transect that spans the arid to hyperarid transition (21 to ∼2mm rain y−1). Landform ages are ⩾2 My based on cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations in surface boulders, and Ar isotopes in interbedded volcanic ash deposits near the driest site indicate a maximum age of 2.1My. A chemical mass balance analysis that explicitly accounts for atmospheric additions was used to quantify net changes in mass and volume as a function of rainfall. In the arid (21mmrainy−1) soil, total mass loss to weathering of silicate alluvium and dust (−1030kgm−2) is offset by net addition of salts (+170kgm−2). The most hyperarid soil has accumulated 830kgm−2 of atmospheric salts (including 260kg sulfate m−2 and 90kgchloridem−2), resulting in unusually high volumetric expansion (120%) for a soil of this age. The composition of both airborne particles and atmospheric deposition in passive traps indicates that the geochemistry of the driest soil reflects accumulated atmospheric influxes coupled with limited in-soil chemical transformation and loss. Long-term rates of atmospheric solute addition were derived from the ion inventories in the driest soil, divided by the landform age, and compared to measured contemporary rates. With decreasing rainfall, the soil salt inventories increase, and the retained salts are both more soluble and present at shallower depths. All soils generally exhibit vertical variation in their chemistry, suggesting slow and stochastic downward water movement, and greater climate variability over the past 2My than is reflected in recent (∼100y) rainfall averages. The geochemistry of these soils shows that the transition from arid to hyperarid rainfall levels marks a fundamental geochemical threshold: in wetter soils, the rate and character of chemical weathering results in net mass loss and associated volumetric collapse after 105 to 106 years, while continuous accumulation of atmospheric solutes in hyperarid soils over similar timescales results in dramatic volumetric expansion. The specific geochemistry of hyperarid soils is a function of atmospheric sources, and is expected to vary accordingly at other hyperarid sites. This work identifies key processes in hyperarid soil formation that are likely to be independent of location, and suggests that analogous processes may occur on Mars.},

   abstract = {Landscapes are shaped by the uplift, deformation and breakdown of bedrock and the erosion, transport and deposition of sediment. Life is important in all of these processes. Over short timescales, the impact of life is quite apparent: rock weathering, soil formation and erosion, slope stability and river dynamics are directly influenced by biotic processes that mediate chemical reactions, dilate soil, disrupt the ground surface and add strength with a weave of roots. Over geologic time, biotic effects are less obvious but equally important: biota affect climate, and climatic conditions dictate the mechanisms and rates of erosion that control topographic evolution. Apart from the obvious influence of humans, does the resulting landscape bear an unmistakable stamp of life? The influence of life on topography is a topic that has remained largely unexplored. Erosion laws that explicitly include biotic effects are needed to explore how intrinsically small-scale biotic processes can influence the form of entire landscapes, and to determine whether these processes create a distinctive topography.},

   abstract = {Biological soil crusts are a diverse soil surface community, prevalent in semiarid regions, which function as ecosystem engineers and perform numerous important ecosystem services. Loss of crusts has been implicated as a factor leading to accelerated soil erosion and other forms of land degradation. To support assessment and monitoring efforts aimed at ensuring the sustainability of rangeland ecosystems, managers require spatially explicit information concerning potential cover and composition of biological soil crusts. We sampled low disturbance sites in Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument (Utah, USA) to determine the feasibility of modeling the potential cover and composition of biological soil crusts in a large area. We used classification and regression trees to model cover of four crust types (light cyanobacterial, dark cyanobacterial, moss, lichen) and 1 cyanobacterial biomass proxy (chlorophyll a), based upon a parsimonious set of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data layers (soil types, precipitation, and elevation). Soil type was consistently the best predictor, although elevation and precipitation were both invoked in the various models. Predicted and observed values for the dark cyanobacterial, moss, and lichen models corresponded moderately well (R2 = 0.49, 0.64, 0.55, respectively). Cover of late successional crust elements (moss + lichen + dark cyanobacterial) was also successfully modeled (R2 = 0.64). We were less successful with models of light cyanobacterial cover (R2 = 0.22) and chlorophyll a (R2 = 0.09). We believe that our difficulty modeling chlorophyll a concentration is related to a severe drought and subsequent cyanobacterial mortality during the course of the study. These models provide the necessary reference conditions to facilitate the comparison between the actual cover and composition of biological soil crusts at a given site and their potential cover and composition condition so that sites in poor condition can be identified and management actions can be taken. Resumen Las costras biológicas de suelo son una comunidad diversa de la superficie del suelo, prevalecientes en las regiones semiáridas, y las cuales funcionan como ecosistemas y realizan numerosos servicios ecológico importantes. La perdida de estas costras has sido implicada como un factor que conduce a una erosión acelerada de suelo y otras formas de degradación de las tierras. Para sostener las acciones de evaluación y monitoreo encaminadas a asegurar la sostenibilidad de los ecosistemas de pastizal, los manejadores requieren de información espacial explícita concerniente a la cobertura potencial y composición de las costras biológicas del suelo. En el Monumento Nacional Grand Staircase–Escalante (Utah, USA) muestreamos sitios con poco disturbio para determinar la factibilidad de modelar la cobertura potencial y composición de la costra biológica de una área mayor. Utilizamos árboles de clasificación y regresión para modelar la cobertura de cuatro tipos de costra (cianobacterial clara, cianobacterial obscura, musgo, y liquen) y una derivación de la biomasa cianobacterial (chlorophyll a), basados en un parsimonioso juego de capas de datos de Sistemas de Información Geográfica (GIS) (tipos de suelos, precipitación, y elevación). El tipo de suelo fue consistentemente el mejor predictor, aunque la elevación y precipitación fueron invocadas en varios de los modelos. Los valores predichos y observados para las cianobacterias obscuras y musgos correspondieron moderadamente bien (R2 = 0.49, 0.64, 0.55, respectivamente). La cobertura de elementos de la costra de etapas serales finales (musgo + liquen + cianobacterias obscuras) fue también modelada exitosamente (R2 = 0.64). Fuimos menos exitosos con los modelos de la cobertura de cianobacterias claras (R2 = 0.22) y clorofila a (R2 = 0.09). Creemos que nuestra dificultad para modelar la concentración de clorofila a esta relacionada a una severa sequía y la mortalidad subsecuente de las cianobacterias durante el curso de este estudio. Estos modelos proveen las condiciones de referencia necesarias para facilitar la comparación entre la cobertura y composición actuales de las costras biológicas del suelo en un sitio dado y su condición potencial de cobertura y composición de tal forma que sitios en condición pobre pueden ser identificados y pueden ser tomadas acciones de manejo.},

   abstract = {Bryophytes are a non-monophyletic group of three major lineages (liverworts, hornworts, and mosses) that descend from the earliest branching events in the phylogeny of land plants. We postulate that desiccation tolerance is a primitive trait, thus mechanisms by which the first land plants achieved tolerance may be reflected in how extant desiccation-tolerant bryophytes survive drying. Evidence is consistent with extant bryophytes employing a tolerance strategy of constitutive cellular protection coupled with induction of a recovery/repair mechanism upon rehydration. Cellular structures appear intact in the desiccated state but are disrupted by rapid uptake of water upon rehydration, but cellular integrity is rapidly regained. The photosynthetic machinery appears to be protected such that photosynthetic activity recovers quickly. Gene expression responds following rehydration and not during drying. Gene expression is translationally controlled and results in the synthesis of a number of proteins, collectively called rehydrins. Some prominent rehydrins are similar to Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins, classically ascribed a protection function during desiccation. The role of LEA proteins in a rehydrating system is unknown but data indicates a function in stabilization and reconstitution of membranes. Phylogenetic studies using a Tortula ruralis LEA-like rehydrin led to a re-examination of the evolution of desiccation tolerance. A new phylogenetic analysis suggests that: (i) the basic mechanisms of tolerance seen in modern day bryophytes have changed little from the earliest manifestations of desiccation tolerance in land plants, and (ii) vegetative desiccation tolerance in the early land plants may have evolved from a mechanism present first in spores.},

The results of laboratory experiments with biofilms on quartz sand and glass were compared with material from the field. Microscopic (optical and SEM) analysis of quartz sand weathered in vitro by a microbial community of cyanobacteria, diatoms and heterotrophic bacteria demonstrate grain diminution of a sand fraction of North Sea sediment. The microbial community changes the minerals in the vicinity of the living cells, which leave their mark on the quartz surface in form of imprints, depressions and pits. Subsequently microbial growth on the surface brought about a general decrease of the grain size in the layer beneath a biofilm. Imprints of diatoms on glass surfaces colonized by diatoms and heterotrophic bacteria confirm the chemical etching activity of these organisms. Mixed cultures of diatoms and bacteria show depressions corresponding to the shape of individual cells. Our experiments confirm that diatoms, heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria from natural biofilms can actively attack quartz and glass. Microscopic analysis of an idiomorphic scepter quartz crystal from a Tepui weathering environment reveals that the associated biofilms can create a local shift in the pH from 3.4 (pH of water on the Tepui) to evidently higher than 9 (necessary for quartz dissolution). The quartz covered with a biofilm is partially perforated to a depth of more than 4 mm. We conclude that biofilm growth in marine (sub-aquatic) and terrestrial (sub-aerial) conditions can significantly increase the breakdown of silica in the amorphous (glass), sub-crystalline (chert), crystalline and granular forms of quartz. Microbial growth may therefore substantially modify the processes of transformation of a major rock forming mineral of great chemical and physical resistance.},

   pages = {7-31},
   abstract = {Since the 1900s, the link between soil biotic activity, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilization, and soil aggregate dynamics has been recognized and intensively been studied. By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated the influence of the five major factors (i.e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950, four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next, Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and macroaggregate formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) macroaggregate turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area of research reveals that still very few studies are quantitative and/or consider interactive effects between the five factors. The quantification of these relationships is clearly needed to improve our ability to predict changes in soil ecosystems due to management and global change. This quantification can greatly benefit from viewing aggregates as dynamic rather than static entities and relating aggregate measurements with 2D and 3D quantitative spatial information.},

Under LGM conditions an icesheet with a modelled volume slightly in excess of 500,000km3 builds up along the Andes. There is a marked contrast between the maritime and continental flanks of the modelled icesheet, with positive mass balance exceeding 2m in the west and declining tenfold to the east. Modelled ice velocities commonly reach 400myr−1 in the western fjords. The model is most sensitive to variations in temperature and good agreement between modelled ice extent and empirical evidence was achieved by applying a temperature decrease of 6°C relative to present day temperatures with constant wind fields over the model domain. Assuming a stepped start to deglaciation, modelled ice volumes declined sharply, contributing 1.2m to global sea level, 80% of it within 2000 years. The empirical record suggests that such a stepped warming occurred around 17,500–17,150calyr ago.},

   abstract = {Soil structure is defined as the arrangement of particles and associated pores in soils across the size range from nanometres to centimetres. Biologic influences can be demonstrated in the formation and stabilization of aggregates but it is necessary to distinguish clearly between those forces or agencies which create aggregations of particles and those which stabilize or degrade such aggregations. The formation of soil structure involves the physical forces of shrinking and swelling created by changes in water status of soils, freezing and thawing, tillage, or by movement of the larger biota in soils. Expansive properties of soils are controlled by the clay content. Thus changes of structural organisation are minimal in sands and maximal in clays. Plant roots, earthworms and other macrofauna large enough to move soil particles create pores recognisable by cylindrical shapes and smooth curved surfaces. Various visual and microscopic techniques aided by dyes are available to demonstrate the extent of biovoids in soils. Biology plays a major role in stabilization of soil structure. The major factors vary depending on the scale of soil structure. At larger scales plant roots and associated hyphae can be seen to enmesh soil particles by acting as a “sticky string bag”. At the microscale the influence of mucilages from roots, hyphae, bacteria and fauna such as earthworms can be shown by a range of microscopic techniques to be involved in stabilizing smaller aggregates and the linings of biopores. Techniques include optical and fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy including EDAX, transmission electron microscopy using heavy metals or other electron dense staining techniques for specific chemical compounds, and computer aided tomography. The microscopic techniques can be used on individual aggregates, stabilized soils, sections or separates of soils. Both microflora and fauna are involved in the degradation of stabilizing agents. Fauna may comminute roots and hyphae which stabilized larger aggregates and microorganisms utilize mucilaginous stabilizing agents as an energy source resulting in a slow breakdown of structural stability. Such effects can be established by combinations of studies of aggregation including microscopy. Further destruction of structure is caused by tillage and compaction by vehicles and animals.},

   abstract = {Abstract This work corroborates the hierarchical conceptual model for soil aggregate structure presented by Tisdall and Oades (1982), extends it to North American grassland soils, and elaborates on the aspects relating to the influence of cultivation upon losses of soil organic matter. Aggregate size distributions observed for our soils are very similar to those of Australian soils, indicating that the microaggregate-macroaggregate model may hold for a wide array of grassland soils from around the world. The use of two wetting treatments prior to sieving demonstrated that the native sod soil had the same general structural characteristics as cultivated soil but the macroaggregates were more stable. When slaked, native and cultivated soil present in the microaggregate size classes had less organic C, N, and P than the soil remaining as macroaggregates, even when expressed on a sand-free basis. Moreover, the C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios of microaggregates were narrower than those of macroaggregate size classes. Much more C and N was lost than P under the conditions of this study. Element-specific differences in microbial catabolic processes vs. extracellular enzyme activity and its attendant feedback controls are postulated to account for this difference. When the macroaggregates were crushed to the size of microaggregates, mineralizable C as a percent of the total organic C was generally greater for macro- than microaggregates early in the incubation for the cultivated soil and throughout most of the incubation for the native sod soil. Mineralizable N as a percent of the total organic N was greatest in macroaggregates even when the macroaggregates were not crushed. The macroaggregate-micraggregate conceptual model is applied to help explain accumulation of soil organic matter under native conditions and its loss upon cultivation.},
